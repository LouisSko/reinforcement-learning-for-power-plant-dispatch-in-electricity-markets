# Basic RL Envi for DAM Bidding

In this Git Lab Project you can collaborate for the BDA case challenge. The inital files provided include an example gym environment, to give you an idea of the task as well as a template for downloading data from the ENTSO-E transparency plattform and the simple day-ahead market clearing file.

These files only serve as an indication on how you set up an RL environment. They do work if the data is provided accordingly, but must not be used. 

Have fun!
